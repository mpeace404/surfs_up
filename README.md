# Surf's Up!

## Overview of Surf's Up

### Purpose

W.Avy is a potential investor for the unnamed surf shop/ice cream parlor; but he would like more weather information. He is specifically looking for weather data from June and December to determine if the business is sustainable year round. The deliverables will provide he statistics from weather data from June and December.


 ## Results

After the deliverables were completed, it was determined that:

* While it is expected that December will have cooler temps, the change isn't really that drastic. Low temps have the largest disparity, averaging 56 degrees in December, and 64 degrees in June
* Average temps are nearly comparable, with an average temp of 74 degrees in June and 71 degrees in December
* Max temps for both months are in the low to mid 80s

## Summary

While it is slightly cooler in December, it's definitely still ice cream weather. The surf shop has good potential to be successful year round!
I would consider queries that would focus on a breakdown of weather patterns over a shorter unit of time within June or December. This data could be used for marketing, if a heat wave is noticed, offer a shaved ice special to help customers cool off. In December look for a pattern of cold snaps, and offer warmer drinks or fresh baked items to keep warm during the cooler mornings
